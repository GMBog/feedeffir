# feedeffir

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of feedeffir is to process feed efficiency files and calculate
total dry matter intake, metabolic body weight, delta body weight, and
milk energy.

## Installation

You can install the development version of feedeffir from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("GMBog/feedeffir")
```

feedeffir handles two main types of data:

1.  **Raw Data**:
    - **Description**: This includes unprocessed datasets directly from
      the farm. Examples are raw milk weights from DC and AFI system,
      feed intake files from RIC2 Discover system, and milk composition
      files.
    - **Usage**: Functions that operate on raw data are designed for
      pre-processing and compilation.
2.  **Compiled Feed Efficiency Data**:
    - **Description**: This includes compiled datasets from raw data and
      include metrics such as milk weights, milk composition, and feed
      intakes.
    - **Usage**: Functions targeting compiled files focus on analyzing
      feed efficiency traits. They require data that has already been
      processed from raw inputs.

### How to Use

To work with **raw data**, use functions to preprocess and create the
initial data sets:

- `process_VRfiles()`
- `process_DC_milkw()`
- `process_AFI_milkw()`

To compile data, use the `compiler()` function with different types of
files (body weights, milk weights, milk composition, and VR).

To analyze **compiled feed efficiency files**, use functions which
expect compiled data:

- `process_bw()`
- `process_intakes()`
- `calculate_milke()`

For detailed examples of how to use these functions, refer to the
[Examples](#examples) section.

## Examples

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(feedeffir)

# Process VR files with intakes
data <- process_VRfiles(
  exp = "Study1",
  VRfile = system.file("extdata", "VR240724.DAT", package = "feedeffir"),
  bins = seq(1, 32),
  save_dir = tempdir()
)
#> The VR file was processed and the result saved at /var/folders/8n/lmf4l1hs7jz2m86j5g16k21c0000gn/T//RtmpTQwVbw
```
